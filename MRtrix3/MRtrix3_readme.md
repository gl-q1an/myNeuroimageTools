## Structure Connectome

I primarily used MRtrix3 for connectome analysis. I do the faster steps first, then the slower steps. I try to delete the unimportant intermediate files, because the intermediate files generated by MRtrix3 take up much space.

Some of these steps are automatically processed by multiple cores, so it is not suitable for parallelization.

Our data does not have a reverse B0 for correction, so we cannot perform relevant quality control. In addition, there are only two B values, which also limits the model selection of the response function.
